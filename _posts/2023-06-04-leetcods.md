Given an array nums containing *n* distinct numbers in the range *[1, n]*,
return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [3,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [1,4]. 
2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [1,2]. 
3 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

### Constraints:
- *n == nums.length*
- *1 <= n <= 104*
- *0 <= nums[i] <= n*
- *All the numbers of nums are unique.*

### 1st Approach:
1. We start by sort the array
2. Then loop until we found that *nums[i] != nums[i-1] + 1* => return *num[i] - 1*
3. Or return `*nums.length* if not found any

### 2nd Approach
1. We need a hashmap to indicate if the number is existed.
2. Loop every number and update its state in hashmap to true.
   (or any value, just to show that the key is existed in the hasmap)
3. We loop once again from 1 -> n to find the missing key. then return.

### The Last Approach
Remember a Math equation we learnt from high school to calculate Sum of number from 1 -> n?

$$ \sum_{n=1}^n n = {n \over 2} (n + 1) $$
